# a-Small-C-Compiler-Frontend
Design of a Small Compiler Frontend Based on Little C

The project consists of four parts: pre-task, task 1, task 2, and task 3. 

The pre-task explores the evaluation of expression statements, task 1 involves lexical analysis, task 2 focuses on syntax analysis, and task 3 covers static semantic checking and intermediate code generation, with the intermediate code represented in the form of quadruples. 

Additionally, to enable smooth execution of the project, we have integrated the aforementioned components into the "all" folder and streamlined some of the code.
